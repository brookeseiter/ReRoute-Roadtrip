Embark on the ultimate adventure with ReRoute Roadtrip, a road trip-planning application that helps users discover unique stops along their route before their journey even begins. From well-known sites to off-the-beaten-path gems shared by locals, users can customize their trip by adding or removing stops shown on the map. Potential road trip routes are displayed dynamically in response to user engagement and provide real-time insights into trip time, distance, and directions along the chosen path. While on the road, users can contribute to the community by creating new stops and leaving reviews for fellow explorers to uncover.
